## Who am I?

A traveler on a distant planet seeking to find the meaning of meaning and everything else.

## What is this blog about?

A collection of my observations on this planet as well as musings on meaning.

I have taken heavy inspiration from Douglas Hofstadter with his delightful and fascinating ventures into a variety of topics. While Hostadter generally focused on what he titled "Strange Loops", I want to focus on emergence of meaning.

This means that my website will include themes of semiotics, hermeneutics, and cognitive science along with taking particular examples from a variety of fields.
